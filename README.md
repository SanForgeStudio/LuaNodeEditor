<b>Lua Node Editor</b> is a powerful visual scripting IDE that uses nodes to program visually by using it with the Lua scripting language. Our tool is unique and powerful in its own way as it can be used for projects in multiple industries.
<br/>

# Why Lua?
For those new to coding Lua is a very lightweight scripting language, because it is a quick and powerful language and a very needed language in alot of industries. It is used in massive projects for example Roblox, BeamNG, Xplane. For us we think that learning is key! With the Lua Node Editor, you see the logic unfold visually, in getting a deeper understanding of the programming concepts used by Lua.


# Why Visual Programming?
Simplicity simply Meets Power, embrace coding without the intimidation of having knowledge in programming. The Lua Node Editor simplifies Lua programming through a visual language, making it an ideal starting point for no experienced beginners, professionals and experts that wish to understand Lua better.
The overall idea of this tool is to ensure everyone can use it how they want, either use our binaries or integrate it to your own system or software and customize it how you like.

**The Advantage of a Visual Programming tool:**
- It can make Lua programming easier, faster, and more fun, especially for beginners or people who are not comfortable with writing code.
- It can provide a visual overview of the structure and functionality of the program, which can help with debugging, testing, and understanding the code.
- It can enable rapid prototyping and experimentation, because you can quickly create and modify nodes and see fast results.
- It eventually can easily integrate with other software and frameworks that use Lua like any other IDE.

# The power of nodes
Because the Lua Node Editor is based on learning and exploring and making code more fun, similar to many tools that use visual programming for example Scratch or the Unreal Engine, We hope to accomplish alot of breakthroughs with this tool and making it a highly advanced tool.
The Lua Node Editor has currently a total of 34 integrated nodes in which more will be added later, Every node is specifically designed to work with the lua programming workflow you can see them all explained and individually [here](https://github.com/SanForgeStudio/LuaNodeEditor/wiki/Nodes-Library#integrated-nodes).

# Early development release?
The Lua Node Editor has released but in a early development phase. Purely to receive community feedback and to showcase our innovation to the world. You can find all the old and new releases [here](https://github.com/SanForgeStudio/LuaNodeEditor/releases).

## The Future?
The Lua Node Editor, is a really impressive tool, but our idea is beyond the current scope of the Lua Node Editor, we would like to eventually build a tool for multiple programming languages in one application.
